# LESS Folder Structure

LESS files are prefixed with a number indicating the order they are included in
`00-main.less`

Order matters in CSS and is difficult to manage as projects grow over time.
This convention helps to encourage some extra thought around "where should this
CSS definition go" when adding a new file.

This also helps to visualize the order of CSS when viewing the folder
structure in various tools.
